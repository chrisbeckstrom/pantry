CB's Pantry App v0.001
----------------------
An extremely bare bones  web-based pantry database

* WHY?
I had so many delicious things hidden in our various fridges, freezers,
and pantries but had no way to keep track of them. The goal of this
project is to prevent food waste by having an up-to-date and easy-to-use
database of food.

* LICENSE
Feel free to copy and use for noncommercial purposes. It would be cool
if you credit me. If you improve this, let me know!

* PREREQUISITES
- PHP 5 with web server
- MySQL database

* HOW TO INSTALL
Use the pantr-schema.sql file to create a new database in your MySQL database.
Put all the other files somewhere nice.
Copy "config.dist.php" to "config.php" and change the values accordingly.
That's it!

* USAGE
I think it's pretty self explanatory. My categories and locations may
not fit yours. If so, you can change the code. I'm probably not going
to write a manual or anything because this is really just a tool for
my own personal use. If there's interest, perhaps we could work together
to make it into something better that more folks can use!

* TROUBLESHOOTING
I have no coding training and am a super-amateur. If you have issues I
probably won't be able to help you! 

* CONTACT
That said, feel free to give me a shout.
